description: My lab partner and I collaborated on building a custom processor in Verilog on the DE1-SoC FPGA to control stepper motor operations (full/half steps, timing, loops). We Designed and tested datapath, FSM control logic, and assembly programs, validating through simulation and FPGA prototyping.
