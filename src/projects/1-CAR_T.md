description: "Developed an algorithm that ranks CAR T-cell therapy targets on the basis of predicted efficacy for autoimmune diseases using single cell RNA sequence data. I learned machine learning from scratch that summer after recieving an NSERC fund to do research on the topic, and was able to finish it by the end of the term and even present it in the live stream of Scleroderma Canada in world scleroderma day of 2024!"
