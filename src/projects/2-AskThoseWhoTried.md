description: "Upon being overwhelmed by possible career paths, I conducted a qualitative research project in which I interviewed over 100 individuals about their chosen field of study, their satisfaction levels, and the reasons behind their satisfaction levels. Due to the project's success and the great insight obtained, I compiled and published the results into a book which ended up being sold in my high school."
