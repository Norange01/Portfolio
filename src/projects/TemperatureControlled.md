description: Implemented a closed-loop temperature control system using an LM35 sensor with ADC input on an STM32F429 microcontroller. Configured PWM signals to control fan speed dynamically based on temperature feedback and user-defined setpoints. Integrated LCD display and external buttons to adjust parameters and provide real-time visual feedback.
