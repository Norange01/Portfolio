description: "In my third-year design course, we (a group of 4) created a gait assessor device for cerebral palsy patients using a simple ESP32 microcontroller and a BNO055 orientation sensor. We used MATLAB for signal processing and for creating the UI. At the end, we successfully saw clear patterns between normal gait and abnormal gait!"
