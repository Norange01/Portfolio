description: "When 3 or more users react to a message with a potato emoji, these are considered votes that the message is bullying, which makes the bot send a comeback picked randomly from a txt file with comeback lines. Anyone can add to the combacks list and the name of each contributor is stored for security purposes. Because the bot had more evil audience, I added some bullying features, such as meme making (my favorite, create a meme in a second), joining a voice chat for pranking with a game voiceline, and some useful features like automatically sending the contents of a reddit post when a link is shared and the feature of inverting the colors of an image."
