description: My lab partner and I implemented FIR filter and echo machine in Verilog on a DE1-SoC FPGA, applying DSP concepts for real-time audio processing. We designed filter with MATLAB and utilized LPM multiplier and RAM-based shift register modules for efficient FPGA resource use. Finally, we integrated and tested full DSP subsystem with codec interface, enabling noise filtering and dynamic echo on live audio input.
