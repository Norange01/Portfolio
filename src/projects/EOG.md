description: Designed and built a multistage bioinstrumentation amplifier and filter system for electrooculography signal acquisition. Integrated level-shifting, differential amplification, and 60 Hz notch filtering, and successfully used it for a computer task. Operated the system on an isolated biomedical lab board incorporating an isolation transformer for safety and signal integrity.
