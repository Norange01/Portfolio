# Noor Al-Rajab's Portfolio
Right after graduating in 2025, I learned how to code websites from just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the Astro framework just to create my very own website with no restricitons on creativity. This project got me interested in web development and design, after which I started hosting other projects online due to how tempting web application accessibility is. Feel free to give any feedback (I accept roasting as well) and let me know if you would like to collaborate on any cool projects!
